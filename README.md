## Java if-else Conditional Statements Example

This project provides a detailed example of how to use if, else if, and else conditional statements in Java. The code calculates the sum of two numbers and prints various messages based on the total value according to specific ranges.

## Features:
Defines two int variables (number1 and number2) and calculates their sum.
Uses an if-else structure to evaluate the total against certain conditions:
If the total is greater than 50, it prints "Total is greater than 50."
If the total is less than 25, it prints "Total is less than 25."
If neither condition is met (i.e., the total is between 25 and 50), it prints "Total between 25 and 50."
## Code Breakdown:
int number1 = 15; and int number2 = 15; define two integer variables.
The total variable stores the sum of number1 and number2.
The if-else structure checks the value of total and prints the corresponding message.
## Usage:
This example serves as a simple and educational reference for understanding the basic use of conditional statements in Java. You can modify the values of number1 and number2 to test different totals and observe how the if-else statements work.

## Additional Information:
Conditional Statements: Conditional statements allow certain parts of the program to execute only if specific conditions are met. This is an important way to control the flow of a program.
if Statement: Executes the code block if the specified condition is true.
else if Statement: Checks another condition if the first if condition is false.
else Statement: Executes if none of the previous conditions are true and generally performs a default action.
